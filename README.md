# PomoTodo

PomoTodo is a side project of mine that combines the functionality of a Pomodoro Timer and a To-do list. 
## Motivation

To help myself stay organized, motivated and to not self inflict burnout I regularly use the 
Pomodoro technique to break my work load down into manageable chunks.

So what better way to practice my skills by building my own Pomodoro timer combined with a to-do list.
